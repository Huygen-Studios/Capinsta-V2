const faqs = [
	{
		q: "Is Capinsta free?",
		a: "Yes. Capinsta is free to use. You can upload videos, generate captions, style them, and export without paying.",
	},
	{
		q: "Do I need to create an account?",
		a: "No. Capinsta does not require an account, login, or sign-up. Just open the editor and start.",
	},
	{
		q: "What video formats are supported for upload?",
		a: "Common formats including MP4 and WebM. The editor accepts most video files that play in modern browsers.",
	},
	{
		q: "What languages are supported for caption generation?",
		a: "English, Hinglish (Hindi-English mixed), Telgish (Telugu-English mixed), and an auto-detect mode for mixed Indian-language content.",
	},
	{
		q: "Can I edit the generated captions?",
		a: "Yes. You can edit caption text, adjust timing by dragging on the timeline, split and merge segments, and preview changes in real time.",
	},
	{
		q: "What export formats are available?",
		a: "You can export a full captioned video (MP4) with subtitles burned in, or export just the captions as SRT or VTT subtitle files that work with any video editor.",
	},
	{
		q: "What is active-word highlighting?",
		a: "Active-word highlighting displays each spoken word with emphasis (bold, color change, or background) at the exact moment it is spoken during playback. This makes captions more engaging and accessible.",
	},
	{
		q: "Is my uploaded video stored permanently?",
		a: "Your video and project are stored locally in this browser until you delete the project or clear site data. Capinsta does not upload source video to its servers.",
	},
	{
		q: "What happens to my project if I close the browser?",
		a: "The project remains in local browser storage and can be reopened from the projects screen using the same browser profile.",
	},
	{
		q: "Should I download my export before leaving?",
		a: "Download finished exports when you need them as ordinary files. The editable project remains in browser storage until you remove it or clear site data.",
	},
	{
		q: "Are there watermarks on exports?",
		a: "No. Capinsta does not add watermarks to exported videos or subtitle files.",
	},
	{
		q: "Is there a file size or duration limit?",
		a: "Because Capinsta is a free, browser-based service, very large or very long videos may take longer to process or may not be supported. We recommend clips under a few minutes for the best experience.",
	},
	{
		q: "Can I use Capinsta captions in other video editors?",
		a: "Yes. Export captions as SRT or VTT and import them into editors like Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve, CapCut, or any tool that supports sidecar subtitles.",
	},
	{
		q: "Who operates Capinsta?",
		a: `${BRAND.productName} is a product by ${BRAND.parentCompany}. For inquiries, contact ${BRAND.supportEmail}.`,
